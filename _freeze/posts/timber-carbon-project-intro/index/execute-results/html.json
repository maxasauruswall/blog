How much? A 2017 study estimated that we'll need to sequester ~200 billion tons of C02 by 2050 [^1]. That's about the weight of two million aircraft carriers.\n\nTrees seem to be pretty good at sequestering carbon. In fact, a recent study suggested that the IPCC goal of reforesting 1 billion hectares would result in ~205 billion tons of carbon sequestered [^2]. Perfect! Unless... we don't end up reforesting those 1 billion ha after all. From a cursory google search, it sounds like the global market for wood products is expected to grow by 1/3 to $900 billion by 2026 [^3]. And we're gonna need a lot more food by 2050... \n\n\n\n\n\n[^1]: Mac Dowell, N., Fennell, P., Shah, N. et al. The role of CO2 capture and utilization in mitigating climate change.
