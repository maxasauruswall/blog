    "text": "To avoid catastrophic climate change, not only do we need to curb emissions, we’ll also probably have to pull a bunch of C02 out of the air. How much? A 2017 study estimated that we’ll need to sequester ~200 billion tons of C02 by 2050 1. That’s about the weight of two million aircraft carriers.\nTrees seem to be pretty good at sequestering carbon. In fact, a recent study suggested that the IPCC goal of reforesting 1 billion hectares would result in ~205 billion tons of carbon sequestered 2. Perfect! Unless… we don’t end up reforesting those 1 billion ha after all. From a cursory google search, it sounds like the global market for wood products is expected to grow by 1/3 to $900 billion by 2026 3. And we’re gonna need a lot more food by 2050…\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nMac Dowell, N., Fennell, P., Shah, N. et al. The role of CO2 capture and utilization in mitigating climate change.
